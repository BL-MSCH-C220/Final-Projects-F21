# Project Name
Antidote, November 2021

## Theme
We interact with the theme by making a game where your character is poisoned and you have to find/make/buy the antidote!

## Game Play
Cure your poisoning by getting enough points (Getting coins and ingredients)
Use W to jump, use A to move left, and D to move right
