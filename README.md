# Final-Projects—Fall-2021

The fall 2021 game jam was held from 30 November—2 December 2021. The theme for the jam was "Pick Your Poison" (students were given an optional, alternate theme of "You are the closest thing I have to a friend"). The class members organized into groups (2–4 members) and created a game from scratch in 49 hours consistent with that theme.

The groups presented their projects in class, and the projects are kept here for future reference. The grading criteria were as follows:
 * [7 points] A playable game
 * [2] No syntax or runtime errors
 * [3] Is a reflection of the theme
 * [5] It is obvious that every member contributed
 * [2] It is appropriately licensed, and the README.md conforms to the specified format
 * [1] Screenshot or gameplay video
